# Seismic analysis of 2020-04-06 bolide event near Salzburg

On April 6th, 2020, a bolide was sighted near Salzburg. This repository provides two python scripts to a) download seismic data from stations near the trajectory and b) visualize the data to check for arrivals.

If you are not member of the AlpArray project and don't have an EIDA-token that allows you download AlpArray data (Z3 network), you will need to adapt the data-download-script to not reference the token and exclude Z3 data from being requested.

## Results

It appears that the bolide has not produced significant seisimc or acoustic signals that could have been recorded by nearby seismic stations. This is an initial interpretation. Feel free to dig deeper.
